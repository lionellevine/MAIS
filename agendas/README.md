# Math for AI Safety: research agendas

Agendas are clusters of related [open problems](../open-problems/). An agenda can also include progress toward resolving its problems. If enough progress is made, an agenda can spin off one or more [papers](../papers/).

Each agenda has a unique permanent identifier of the form MAIS-An where n is a natural number. The seed agendas A1–A8 each expand on one open problem from the survey [*Math for AI Safety: An Invitation for Mathematicians*](../papers/P1/MAIS-P1.pdf). I expect to add more agendas.

Got your own agenda? [Open an issue](https://github.com/lionellevine/MAIS/issues/new/choose) to propose including it here!

Each agenda's folder is its landing page, with the abstract and links — like an arXiv abstract page.

## What each agenda contains

**MAIS-A1 · Quantitative bounded Löb.** Löb's theorem converts a proof of "if $P$ is provable then $P$" into a proof of $P$ outright, by an explicit construction with an explicit cost. This agenda asks what that cost is: it defines the least overhead $F(k,n)$ such that a $k$-symbol proof of the hypothesis guarantees a proof of $P$ of at most $F(k,|P|)$ symbols, proves $F$ well-defined and computable, and poses problems on its growth — among them explicit cooperation thresholds for resource-bounded agents that cooperate by proving each other's cooperation.

**MAIS-A2 · Behavioral tomography of world-models.** Two theorems of Richens and coauthors show that any policy near-optimal across a rich family of interventions determines an approximate causal model of its environment — but the extraction consumes unlimited noiseless queries. This agenda develops the finite-sample side: explicit margin conditions replacing measure-zero genericity, query complexity under exact, sampled, and Boltzmann-perturbed answers, and the error floor imposed by the agent's regret.

**MAIS-A3 · The geometry and identifiability of superposition.** A neural network can store many more concepts than it has dimensions, as nearly orthogonal directions read out through sparse coefficients; the recovery tool used in practice is an $\ell^1$-penalized dictionary learner. Classical dictionary-learning theory assumes independent supports, but real concepts co-occur. Two small propositions bracket the problem: nested supports force merging at small positive penalty, while solo firing restores recovery in the zero-penalty constrained limit. The open problems live between those poles, starting with a two-feature phase boundary.

**MAIS-A4 · Training for interpretability.** Can a training objective make a network's internal features easy to recover? "Easy to interpret" is not yet a mathematical property, and this agenda does not pretend it is: it isolates three precise surrogates — coherence, $\ell^1$-recoverability, monosemanticity — inside a single toy model, proves small theorems marking the boundary of what is easy, and poses the problems that remain where resources are scarce and training means dynamics rather than exact minimization.

**MAIS-A5 · Which irreducible representations does training select?** Small networks trained to multiply in a finite group $G$ discover representation-theoretic algorithms, but *which* irreducible representations appear varies with the random initialization, and no theorem predicts the variation. This agenda defines the training ensemble and a black-box observable — the key set of irreducible representations visible in a trained network's outputs — precisely enough that the question becomes the law of a random subset of $\mathrm{Irr}(G)$.

**MAIS-A6 · Does geometric simplicity force a legible mechanism?** For a quadratic network computing addition mod $p$, the population loss is an explicit degree-six polynomial, and Fourier inversion gives exact fits built from single-frequency neurons — the algorithm found by reverse-engineering trained networks. The headline question: in a fixed ball, is every exact fit of smallest local learning coefficient of this single-frequency form? A proof would connect geometric simplicity to a mechanism one can read from the weights; a counterexample would show that the two notions of simplicity can part ways.

**MAIS-A7 · Effective loss and learning dynamics.** Watanabe's free-energy asymptotics predict which solutions Bayesian learning prefers as sample size grows. Gradient descent is not Bayesian, but in solvable deep-linear models it follows a temporal staircase, learning structures one at a time. This agenda asks whether singular geometry predicts that staircase, formalizing the possible correspondence several inequivalent ways: an Eyring–Kramers law with prefactors governed by real log canonical thresholds, entropic selection within a connected optimal set, effective diffusions on singular strata, and a time–sample dictionary calibrated on the deep linear network.

**MAIS-A8 · A predictive theory of out-of-distribution generalization.** An agent trained to collect a coin that always sat at the right end of its levels learned "move right," not "get the coin." This agenda turns that episode into mathematics: a one-dimensional environment with the degeneracy built in — two policies indistinguishable on the training distribution. The linear case and several infinite-width limits can be solved; the finite-width selection law, its rare-diversity crossover, and the boundary between proxy and goal generalization remain open.

## Where to start

The agendas define their machine-learning terms; the background column names the mathematics they do not teach. Each foothold below is already specified in the corresponding agenda and is intended to be large enough for a first paper, not easy in the sense of a routine exercise. If you want to take one on, open the discussion link before investing serious work.

## Provenance

Each agenda records its own provenance in a `PROVENANCE.md` beside its source, since different agendas may come to be in different ways. The first eight agendas were written and reviewed by AI systems under Lionel Levine's direction — written by **Claude Fable 5** (Anthropic), adversarially reviewed, and independently audited by **GPT 5.6 Sol** (OpenAI); the [audit record](audit/2026-07/) states what was checked and what was repaired. No human has verified every line, and the bylines are meant to say so plainly.

## Rebuilding

To rebuild an agenda, run `latexmk -pdf -interaction=nonstopmode -halt-on-error MAIS-A1.tex` from its folder. Only each `.tex` source and its matching `.pdf` are committed; LaTeX auxiliary files are ignored.
