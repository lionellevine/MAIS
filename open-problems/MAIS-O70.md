The one singular model family solved completely — reduced-rank regression — was solved globally: Aoyagi and Watanabe [AW05] computed the minimum of the local learning coefficient over the whole set of exact fits, as a closed form in four integers. But the estimators now used on neural networks, introduced by Lau, Furman, Wang, Murfet, and Wei [[LFWMW23]](../references/LFWMW23.md), are local, evaluated at a point, and the pointwise values on this benchmark family have never been tabulated. Those estimators matter for safety because they measure which internal mechanism training has selected: two networks fitting the same data by different mechanisms can behave differently on inputs no test anticipated. They now run on billion-parameter models, with exact ground truth known only for a short list of classical families. The benchmark is missing its own answer key.

**Reduced-rank regression** is the model $y = BAx + \text{noise}$: standard Gaussian output density with mean $BAx$, input $x \sim N(0, I_N)$ in $\mathbb{R}^N$, output in $\mathbb{R}^M$, and parameter $w = (A, B)$ with $A \in \mathbb{R}^{H \times N}$, $B \in \mathbb{R}^{M \times H}$ — a two-layer linear network whose exact-fit set for a rank-$r$ truth $B_0 A_0$ is the fiber $W_0 = \lbrace (A,B) : BA = B_0 A_0\rbrace $. The population loss is $K(A,B) = \tfrac12\  \mathbb{E}\lVert (BA - B_0 A_0)\ x \rVert^2$. The local pair $(\lambda(w^\ast ), m(w^\ast ))$ at a point $w^\ast  \in W_0$ is the local learning coefficient and multiplicity: the volume of $\lbrace K \le \varepsilon\rbrace $ in a small ball around $w^\ast $ scales as $\varepsilon^{\lambda(w^\ast )}(\log(1/\varepsilon))^{m(w^\ast )-1}$. Different points of the fiber can be differently singular; the Aoyagi–Watanabe formula, a closed-form case analysis in the four integers $(N, M, H, r)$ stated as Theorem 3.1 in [MAIS-A6](../agendas/A6/), is the minimum over the fiber.

**Problem ([MAIS-A6, Problem 6.3](../agendas/A6/MAIS-A6.tex#L491)).** For reduced-rank regression with parameters $(N, M, H, r)$, prove that the local pair $(\lambda(w^\ast ), m(w^\ast ))$ at a factorization $w^\ast  = (A, B) \in W_0$ depends only on $(\operatorname{rank} A, \operatorname{rank} B)$, and compute the resulting table. Hence characterize the strata on which $\lambda(w^\ast )$ equals the minimum in the Aoyagi–Watanabe theorem. For example, when $N = M = H = 2$ and $r = 0$, a neighborhood of $(I_2, 0)$ has local coefficient $2$, whereas the table gives $3/2$.

In the statement's last sentence, "the table" is the Aoyagi–Watanabe case list, which gives $3/2$ for these parameters. The example shows the stratification is genuine: at $(I_2, 0)$ the equation $BA = 0$ reduces to $B = 0$, a smooth point of the fiber, and the local coefficient $2$ exceeds the global minimum $3/2$. The convergence theory for the estimator at a point is already available via Watanabe's widely applicable Bayesian information criterion (WBIC) [W13]: restricted to a small ball around $w^\ast $, the WBIC estimate converges in probability to $\lambda(w^\ast )$ (agenda Remark 6.4). What is missing is the table itself. A starter sized for one paper: the case $N = M = H = 2$, listing the local pair on each rank stratum of $\lbrace (A,B) : BA = C\rbrace $. Background and the global theorem are in [MAIS-A6](../agendas/A6/).
